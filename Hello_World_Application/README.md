## Objective: 
Start with the basics by creating a Qt application that opens a window displaying "Hello, World!".

## Detailed Explanation:
- Setting Up: Initialize a new Qt Widgets project in Qt Creator. This will be a straightforward application with a single main window.
- UI Design: Drag and drop a QLabel onto the main window using Qt Designer or create it programmatically in the main window's constructor. Set the label's text property to "Hello, World!".
- Run and Test: Compile and run your application to see a window displaying "Hello, World!". This task familiarizes you with the Qt development environment and basic UI elements.
